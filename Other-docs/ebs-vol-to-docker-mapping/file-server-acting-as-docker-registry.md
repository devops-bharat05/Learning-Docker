# Accessing Docker Images from a File Server

This guide outlines three approaches to access Docker images stored on a file server.

---

## **Option 1: Load Images Manually from File Server**

### **Steps:**
1. **Save Docker Image to File Server**
   - Save the Docker image as a tar file:
     ```bash
     docker save <image-name>:<tag> -o <image-name>.tar
     ```
   - Transfer the tar file to the file server using SCP, FTP, or another protocol:
     ```bash
     scp <image-name>.tar user@file-server:/path/to/directory
     ```

2. **Download the Image to Local Machine**
   - Copy the image back from the file server to your local machine:
     ```bash
     scp user@file-server:/path/to/<image-name>.tar .
     ```

3. **Load the Image into Docker**
   - Load the image into Docker:
     ```bash
     docker load -i <image-name>.tar
     ```

## **Option 2: Use File Server as a Private Docker Registry**

### **Steps:**

1. **Set Up a Docker Registry on the File Server**
   - Run a Docker Registry container on the file server:
     ```bash
     docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name registry registry:2
     ```

2. **Push Docker Images to the File Server**
   - Tag the image with the file server's address:
     ```bash
     docker tag <image-name>:<tag> <file-server-ip>:5000/<image-name>:<tag>
     ```
   - Push the image to the registry:
     ```bash
     docker push <file-server-ip>:5000/<image-name>:<tag>
     ```

3. **Pull Images from the File Server**
   - On the client machine, pull the image:
     ```bash
     docker pull <file-server-ip>:5000/<image-name>:<tag>
     ```

4. **(Optional) Configure for Insecure Registries**
   - If the registry does not use HTTPS, add the file server as an insecure registry:
     - Update `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:
       ```json
       {
         "insecure-registries": ["<file-server-ip>:5000"]
       }
       ```
     - Restart Docker:
       ```bash
       sudo systemctl restart docker
       ```

## **Option 3: Access Images via NFS or Shared Mount**

### **Steps:**

1. **Mount the File Server**
   - Mount the file server directory containing the images:
     ```bash
     sudo mount -t nfs <file-server-ip>:/path/to/images /mnt/docker-images
     ```

2. **Load Docker Images**
   - Navigate to the mounted directory and load the image:
     ```bash
     docker load -i /mnt/docker-images/<image-name>.tar
     ```

---

## **Best Practices**

- Use **Option 1** for manual and one-time transfers.
- Use **Option 2** if your file server should act as a dedicated Docker registry.
- Use **Option 3** for continuous and large-scale image sharing.
