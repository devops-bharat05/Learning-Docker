To pull Docker images stored on a file server, you can set up your environment to treat the file server as a private Docker registry or manually load the image from the server. Here's how you can proceed:

---

### **Option 1: Use the File Server as a Docker Registry**

1. **Ensure the File Server is Reachable**
   - Verify that you can access the file server using its IP address or domain.

2. **Transfer Docker Images to the File Server**
   - Push the Docker images to the file server in tar format:
     ```bash
     docker save <image-name>:<tag> -o <image-name>.tar
     ```
     Example:
     ```bash
     docker save my-app:1.0 -o my-app.tar
     ```

3. **Pull the Image from the File Server**
   - Download the tar file from the file server to your local system using SCP, HTTP, or any file transfer protocol:
     ```bash
     scp user@file-server:/path/to/my-app.tar .
     ```
   - Load the image into Docker:
     ```bash
     docker load -i my-app.tar
     ```
   - The image will now be available locally.

### **Option 2: Use the File Server as a Registry Proxy**

If you want to pull directly like a Docker registry:

1. **Set Up a Registry on the File Server**
   - Run a Docker Registry container on the file server:
     ```bash
     docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name registry registry:2
     ```
   - Push the image to this registry:
     ```bash
     docker tag <image-name>:<tag> <file-server-ip>:5000/<image-name>:<tag>
     docker push <file-server-ip>:5000/<image-name>:<tag>
     ```

2. **Pull the Image from the File Server**
   - On the client machine, pull the image:
     ```bash
     docker pull <file-server-ip>:5000/<image-name>:<tag>
     ```

3. **Bypass Secure Connection (Optional)**
   If your file server doesn't use HTTPS:
   - Add the server as an insecure registry in Docker daemon settings (`/etc/docker/daemon.json`):
     ```json
     {
       "insecure-registries": ["<file-server-ip>:5000"]
     }
     ```
   - Restart Docker:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart docker
     ```

---

### **Option 3: Access via NFS or Shared Mount**

1. **Mount the File Server**
   - Mount the file server's directory containing the Docker image tar files:
     ```bash
     sudo mount -t nfs <file-server-ip>:/path/to/images /mnt/docker-images
     ```

2. **Load the Image**
   - Navigate to the mount point and load the image:
     ```bash
     docker load -i /mnt/docker-images/my-app.tar
     ```
